XVi LE ROMAN D'ALEXANDRE: ARSENAL AND VENICE VERSIONS
The digraph æ occurs sporadically in B and À and represents always an e, or
an a written for an e; it is retained in the texts in all cases where it is present
in the manuscript.i3
The writing for B of words with initial es plus consonant indicates that e
should be written wherever practicable, but in cases of the type sa spee 670, la
scriture 4300 the word division has been made before the s;: cf. also lo steüst
2236.
Abbreviations in B are resolved as follows: superposed bar as m, but as n
before non-labials within a word (but as en in comce 4441 and in m 8688, as m
in hüe passim, as r in mäbrine 208 and in côrant 7685): e with superposed bar as
est when the context so demands; 9 as com, but as con before non-labials within
a word; 9 with superposed bar as contra (635, etc.): final 9 as us (desus 5289);
& as e before consonants and as et before vowels (so when the word is written
out in the manuscript, except that when initial in a line the word is sporadically
written et even before a consonant); x as us (except in the word dux) ; p with bar
traversing stem as per (the abbreviation can often be identified as representing
per—s0 23, 697, 870, etc.—but never definitely as representing par or por);
ch’r as chivalier. Abbreviations of proper names and numerals are kept. Sporadic
abbreviations: superposed bar with downward hook as e (prise 9, Arcade 1777,
first e in demandee 1794), also as us (Neptenabus 77), and as et (prophete 5857);

2300, per 2779, nardiers 5943); a superposed undulating stroke as ra (grant
5712, contra 297, graver 7938).
Abbreviations in À are resolved as follows: superposed bar as m, but as n
before non-labials within a word (but hôe as home, & as com, it as ment, and in
Section 3 cô, cü as con, cun); 9 as com (but in Section 3 as con when it has
meaning ‘comme’); ce with superposed undulating stroke as contra; dt with a
